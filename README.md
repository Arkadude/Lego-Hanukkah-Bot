The robot is controlled by a Robot Inventor hub, running Pybricks.
The robot is simply scripted to follow the motions:
  1. Grab a candle that's handed to it (the Shamash).
  2. Wait for user to light it.
  3. Light all 8 candles with the Shamash, waiting a fixed interval until they light.
  4. Place the Shamash in the center candle slot.
  5. Return to initial position.
I aligned all the candle positions preliminarily so it can succeed.
The wooden extention the robot rests upon is an IKEA SIGFINN.
